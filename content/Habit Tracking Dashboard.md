> [!HELP] Here's how to ensure everything works correctly:

1. **Folder Structure:** Make sure all your daily journal files are stored in the "Daily" folder.
2. **Consistent Habit Tracking:** Ensure each daily journal file uses the habit keys exactly as specified:
   - `Wakeup::`
   - `Exercise::`
   - `Word Count::`
   - `Hours of Sleep::`
   - `Reading::`
   - `Meditation::`
   - `Water Intake::`
