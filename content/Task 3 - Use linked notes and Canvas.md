1. Create a doc like this [[Why and How I write with Obsidian]]
2. Use `[[` ... `]]` around notes to create new linked notes![[linked-notes.png]]
3. Linked notes are blank by default. You can copy the same content or type anything in there
4. Create a new Canvas called Mindmap
5. Drag [[Why and How I write with Obsidian]] card from the left sidebar to the blank canvas![[drag-to-canvas-1.png]]
6. Drag link [[why I write for self?]] from inside that card out to the right![[drag-to-canvas-2.png]]
7. Repeat and add a few notes as cards
8. You can create new cards without making them as notes
9. Highlight a few cards, right Click, then create groups with the following names: "on writing", "on Obsidian", "personal why", and "professional why"![[use-groups-in-canvas.png]]
10. Voila! Feel free to do something different. Share your result?
